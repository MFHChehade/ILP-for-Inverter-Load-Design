# MILP-for-Inverter-Load-Design
This work designs the load bank used to test a power electronic inverter. The load consists of several high-power resistors. The aim is to reach a certain electric power level with the least amount of resistors, taking into consideration the physical properties of the resistor. 

For that purpose, an integer linear program (ILP) optimization problem is formulated in the PDF file. 

This optimization problem is then solved using the Optimization Toolbox of MATLAB. This can be found in the MATLAB script file.

### Note: The code exists in ".mlx" and ".m" forms. 
#### The ".mlx" version is suggested for better interpretability.
